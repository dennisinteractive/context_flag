Context_Flag
============

This module provides integration between the Context and Flag modules.
When enabled it creates new Context conditions which can be triggered based on the value of a Flag.

Working
-------
* Node active flags (includes contexts that require multiple flags)
* Current active/logged-in user flags
* User profile active tags
* Features export

Todo
----
* Comment active flags (I'm not sure if this would be useful or not.)
* Entity active flags

Future enhancements (maybe)
---------------------------
* {x} Inactive Flag conditions (testing for flaggable items that do NOT have a selected flag applied to them).
* User Profile flags should work in combination with modified profile pages from modules like Profile2 or Advanced_profile.
